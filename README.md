# Understanding RRSP contributions in Canada

Simple script to understand how RRSP contributions work in Canada.

If you want to run it for your particular circumstances, just edit the lines at 
the top to set your taxable income and your contribution room and run the 
script. You'll get a plot with three panels that show:

* `effective_tax_rate`: the effective tax rate you are paying with that RRSP 
  contribution, in percentage.
* `tax_savings`: how many dollars you're getting back if you contribute that 
  much.
* `rrsp_efficiency`: how efficient your contributions are, in terms of how many 
  dollars you're getting back vs. how much you're contributing, in percentage.
